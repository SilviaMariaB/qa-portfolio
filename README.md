QA Portfolio — Manual & Automated Testing

This repository showcases my experience in both manual and automated testing, including real examples of test documentation, bug reports, and automation frameworks.
It reflects the practical skills listed in my CV, combining structured testing processes with hands-on implementation in modern QA tools.

Manual Testing
- Created detailed test cases, checklists, and mindmaps for web applications
- Logged structured bug reports with clear steps, severity levels, and expected results
- Used Jira and Qase to manage testing workflow and traceability
- Designed visual flowcharts in Canva to map user journeys and system interactions

Automated Testing
- Developed end-to-end UI tests using Cypress with reusable commands and assertions
- Built API test suites in Postman, validating status codes, payloads, and data integrity
- Implemented data-driven and environment-based test setups for scalable automation
- Integrated Cypress projects with a basic CI/CD pipeline for continuous validation
- Documented test collections, workflows, and execution results

Tools & Technologies:
Jira · Qase · Cypress · Postman · JavaScript · HTML/CSS · Git · GitHub · Canva

Goal:
To demonstrate my QA workflow — from test design and bug reporting to automation and integration — while continuously improving my technical testing skills.
