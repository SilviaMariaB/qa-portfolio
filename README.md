QA Portfolio — Manual & Automated Testing

This repository showcases my experience in both manual and automated testing, including real examples of test documentation, bug reports, and automation frameworks.
It reflects the practical skills listed in my CV, combining structured testing processes with hands-on implementation in modern QA tools.

MANUAL TESTING 

- Created detailed test cases and executed them in Jira and Qase
- Logged bug reports with clear reproduction steps, severity, and expected results in Jira
- Designed checklists, mindmaps, and flowcharts in Canva

AUTOMATED TESTING 

- Created end-to-end UI automated tests on SauceDemo (regression, smoke, negative scenarios) with Cypress 
- Used fixtures for multiple test data and custom commands for reusable actions
- Ran Cypress tests locally in terminal (headless) with screenshots saved to GitHub
- Built API tests in Postman (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) with validations: status codes, response time, required fields, and correct data types
- Documented Postman collections and environment variables for easy reuse

Tools & Technologies:
Jira · Qase · Cypress · Postman · JavaScript · HTML/CSS · Git · GitHub · Canva

Goal:
To demonstrate my QA workflow — from test design and bug reporting to automation and integration — while continuously improving my technical testing skills.
